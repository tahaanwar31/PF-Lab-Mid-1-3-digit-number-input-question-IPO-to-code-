# PF-Lab-Mid-1-3-digit-number-input-question-IPO-to-code-


I wrote this program to check whether the sum of the first and last digits of a three-digit number is equal to the middle digit. The program starts by asking the user to input a number. It then determines the number of digits by dividing the number by 10 in a loop. If the number has three digits, it extracts the first, second, and third digits. Finally, it checks if the sum of the first and third digits equals the second digit, printing "True" if the condition is met and "False" otherwise. This code was tested in the lab mid-exam of the Programming Fundamentals course at FAST NUCES.
